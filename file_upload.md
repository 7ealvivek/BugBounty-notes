# Rate Limiting 


1-> Simple Repeation

 link:- https://hackerone.com/reports/297359


1. Use Burp Suite and capture below request upon navigation to Code integration
2. Click on Send button after entering email address in the input field of 'Enter one or more email addresses and we'll send you links to the integration 
   instructions for this ad unit.'
4. Send the captured request to INtruder and repeat the request in loop
4. Observe that email box is flooded with MoPub ad unit integration instructions


2-> In Private Room you must have password

[Link](https://hackerone.com/reports/385381)

 I made 1k+ request but still server not block my request.

Steps to reproduce:-
1. Create two account A and B. protect A's room with password.
2. Login to B's account and access A's room with random password.
3. Send the request to intruder and run till you get right password 

3-> Bypass of rate limiting work sometime

  I don't remember source but after blocking from a lot of request he just used X-Forwarded-For :127.0.0.1 and after that we are unblocked .
  some 
```json
X-Remote-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Remote-Addr: 127.0.0.1
X-Originating-IP: 127.0.0.1
```

4-> Zseano Breaking Rate Limiting

 [Link:](https://hackerone.com/reports/170310 "hackerone report ")

 noticed when we hit the /users_sign_in endpoint too many times it will give us
 ```
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
```
 However, this can be "reset" although I struggle to get it to work EVERYTIME on /users/sign_in. This however, does work all the time on
 /users/password endpoint hence why i'm reporting so maybe you can investigate further on the /users_sign_in endpoint.

Now send the request around ~10 times and it'll hit "Too Many Requests". Now simply add **%00** on the end of the email and resend even more password reset emails.
```
&user%5Bemail%5D=email@here.com%00 
```
and keep adding %00 everytime you are rate limited. After a while you can go back to just %00 as it resets after so long.

6->  Rate Limiting with X-Forwaded bypass but different

Link :-  https://hackerone.com/reports/723974

- same Intercept req send it to intruder
-  Set payloads to [ Brute force ] to brute force only X-Forwarded-For:  $bing$.com
- Start the attack .

7 -> No rate limiting for sensitive actions (like "forgot password") enables user enumeration

Link :- https://hackerone.com/reports/77067

Send a POST-Request to the url POST /_/api/1.0/send-reset-pw.json HTTP/1.1
send different email and this lead to know which email have account or not.
because those who is registered have different error.
